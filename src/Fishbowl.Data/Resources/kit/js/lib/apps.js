/**
 * SACRVM APPKIT — sac.apps: the app runtime.
 * Registry of app manifests, floating-window lifecycle, ?app= deep links and
 * the mount(context) capability handshake. Supersedes the old sac.launcher
 * lib (whose API survives below as a thin delegating alias).
 *
 * An app = ONE custom element in ONE classic script. The script guards its
 * definition (`if (!customElements.get(TAG)) customElements.define(...)`) and
 * registers no other tags — that is what makes an app portable to any page.
 *
 * Manifest:
 *
 *   sac.apps.register({
 *       id:          "color-bucket",          // unique; ?app= deep links + persistence key
 *       name:        "Color Bucket",          // display name
 *       icon:        "palette",               // sac-icon name
 *       description: "Mix and manage colors", // tile subline (optional)
 *       version:     "1.0.0",                 // optional — shown in About + on install
 *       notices:     [{ title, text }],       // optional — third-party credits, licence
 *                                             // and trademark text; sac.about renders
 *                                             // each as a titled section (+ name/icon/version)
 *       badge:       "NEW",                   // optional — short string, rendered by
 *                                             // <sac-launcher> as the tile's corner pill
 *       tile:        "wide",                  // optional tile footprint in the launcher
 *                                             // grid: "medium" (default, omit-able) |
 *                                             // "wide" (2 columns) | "large" (2 columns
 *                                             // × 2 rows); unknown values fall back to
 *                                             // medium silently
 *       tiles: [                              // optional — MULTIPLE launcher tiles for
 *           { id: "today",                    // one app (complex apps deploy several
 *             name: "Today",                  // entry points into a desktop). When set,
 *             icon: "clock",                  // these REPLACE the app's default tile.
 *             description: "…",               // Each entry may override name/icon/
 *             route: "today",                 // description/badge/tile/accent and adds:
 *             accent: "#e59500" },            //   route  — views: opens "#/<id>/<route>"
 *           …                                 //   params — windows: handed to open()
 *       ],                                    //   accent — colors the tile AND the app
 *                                             //            opened through it (its --accent
 *                                             //            seed — the Windows-Phone move:
 *                                             //            tile color = app highlight)
 *       kind:        "window",                // "window" | "view" | "page"
 *       // kind:"window" and kind:"view":
 *       tag:         "app-color-bucket",      // the app's custom element
 *       src:         "apps/color-bucket.js",  // classic script, injected on first open
 *       accent:      "#10b981",               // optional — set as --accent on the app
 *       // kind:"window" only:
 *       width:       "520px", height: "640px",// sac-window size (defaults 500px/600px)
 *       controls:    "close",                 // optional — sac-window controls subset ("min max close")
 *       resizable:   false,                   // optional — false sets no-resize on the window
 *       // kind:"page" only:
 *       href:        "orb-lab/",              // tile becomes a normal link
 *       // capabilities — optional, the app's ASK (a host's confirm dialog
 *       // lists them; what is actually handed over is the host's grant):
 *       permissions: { files: true, identity: true }, // beyond the always-on fs
 *       connect:     ["https://api.example.com"],     // https origins it talks to
 *       opens:       ["image/png", ".png"],           // "Open with…" metadata
 *       isolated:    true,                    // optional — the app asks to be
 *                                             // sandboxed; can only RAISE isolation
 *   });
 *   sac.apps.init();   // binds [data-app] tiles + ?app= deep links
 *
 * The three kinds — where an app runs:
 *
 *   "window"  floats above the shell in a <sac-window>. Small tools, things
 *             you want beside your work.
 *   "view"    takes over the shell's stage: ONE hub, everything else an app.
 *             Addressed by hash — "#/<id>", with the app's own sub-route
 *             after it ("#/styleguide/components"), so back/forward and
 *             bookmarks work. The element is created once and kept (hidden)
 *             when you switch away, so state survives; mount() runs once.
 *             A view is a COMPLETE app: it draws its own chrome — nav,
 *             toolbar, rail — in its own markup. The host injects context
 *             into it (context.host: jump-home, the suite's navigation,
 *             the host's toolbar controls — all rendered by the app's own
 *             nav), never the other way around.
 *   "page"    its own document. Only for apps that must also stand alone.
 *
 * Shell contract for views (see kit/templates/shell.html):
 *
 *   sac.apps.init({ viewHost: "#app-stage", home: "#app-home",
 *                   host: { name: "MY DESKTOP", icon: "cube", href: "#/" } });
 *
 *   viewHost — element the view elements are appended to (default "#app-root",
 *              the kit's SPA convention)
 *   home     — element shown while no view is active, i.e. at "#/" (optional)
 *   host     — what this host injects into every view's own chrome; apps
 *              receive it as context.host and assign it to their own nav
 *              (nav.host = context.host). Shape: { name, icon, href,
 *              nav: [{label, href, icon?}],  → the suite's cross-app
 *              navigation, shown as a host group in the app's burger panel
 *              toolbar: [{icon, label?, title?, href?|onClick?}] } → host
 *              controls at the right end of the app's ribbon (a signed-in
 *              user, a suite-wide action). Optional — without it apps show
 *              no host presence.
 *
 * API:
 *   register(manifest, opts?)  upsert by id (re-register replaces; first
 *                        registration fixes the list order). Emits
 *                        "sac:apps-changed" on document.
 *                        opts { isolated, grant } — the HOST's decision, never
 *                        the manifest's (see "Isolation and grants" below).
 *                        Omitted on a re-register, the previous choice stays.
 *   list()               → array of manifest copies, registration order
 *   get(id)              → manifest copy or null
 *   open(id, params?, opts?) → Promise<HTMLElement> resolving to the app
 *                        element.
 *                        params: URLSearchParams | object | string, handed to
 *                        the app via context.params.
 *                        opts { route, accent }: what a launcher tile carries —
 *                        route opens a view at "#/<id>/<route>", accent seeds
 *                        the app's --accent (tile color = app highlight).
 *                        kind:"page" navigates
 *                        (params appended) and the promise never resolves.
 *                        kind:"window" injects src once (keyed by src), awaits
 *                        customElements.whenDefined(tag) and shows the app in
 *                        a centered, slightly cascaded <sac-window> that stays
 *                        in the DOM and is re-open()ed on later calls.
 *                        Rejects on script load failure (console.error +
 *                        sac.toast if available).
 *                        kind:"view" does the same injection, then puts the
 *                        element on the shell's stage and sets the hash to
 *                        "#/<id>" — the address IS the open call, so a link
 *                        works as well as a click.
 *   close(id)            window: closes it (element + window stay in the DOM).
 *                        view: leaves the stage, back to the home section.
 *   remove(id)           unregister; if the app was created, calls its
 *                        unmount() (when present) and drops window or view.
 *                        Emits "sac:apps-changed".
 *   isOpen(id)           → boolean (window open, or view currently on stage)
 *   isDirty(id)          → boolean — the app said it holds unsaved work
 *                        (context.setDirty). Ask before remove()ing it.
 *   active()             → id of the view on stage, or null
 *   init(options?)       binds click on [data-app="<id>"] tiles (delegated,
 *                        so tiles rendered later work too), handles the
 *                        ?app=<id> deep link, then cleans the URL via
 *                        replaceState, and — when any view app is registered —
 *                        routes the hash. Legacy compatibility: [data-overlay]
 *                        and ?tool= are honored the same way.
 *   inspect(url)         → Promise<manifest> — reads app.json, runs nothing.
 *                        Adds src, origin, manifestUrl and entryIntegrity
 *                        ("sha256-…" of the entry's bytes, or null when the
 *                        entry could not be read or crypto.subtle is missing —
 *                        an insecure context). Rejects a malformed capability
 *                        field (connect not an https origin, …); unknown keys
 *                        pass through untouched.
 *   add(input, opts?)    → Promise<manifest> — inspect (a URL) + register.
 *                        opts { isolated, grant, integrity }. The returned
 *                        manifest carries the pin as `integrity`: keep it with
 *                        the install record and hand it back on the next boot.
 *   policy(id)           → { isolated, granted } — what the host decided, or null
 *   frameOf(id)          → the <iframe> of an isolated app once created, or null
 *
 * Isolation and grants (the host's decision — a manifest cannot make itself
 * trusted; its own `isolated: true` can only raise isolation):
 *   isolated = opts.isolated === true || manifest.isolated === true
 *   An isolated view or window runs in <iframe sandbox="allow-scripts
 *   allow-forms allow-popups allow-downloads"> — never allow-same-origin —
 *   and reaches the host only through the bridge (kit/js/lib/app-bridge.js,
 *   loaded on demand; the frame runs kit/js/lib/app-guest.js). The app gets
 *   the same context shape; context.isolated says true.
 *   grant { files, identity, connect } — what the host hands over.
 *     identity: true (the host's profile as is) | "pseudonymous" | false.
 *     "pseudonymous" hands { id, name, avatar } where id is derived per
 *     (user, app) — SHA-256 over sac.apps.identitySalt + the user's id + the
 *     app's id — so the app cannot recover the real id and two apps cannot
 *     correlate one person; nothing else of the profile crosses. Works for
 *     same-realm apps too. Needs crypto.subtle (a secure context); without
 *     it the pseudonymous identity stays null. Defaults:
 *     isolated      { fs: true, files: false, identity: false, connect: [] }
 *     not isolated  everything the page loaded (as before); connect = the
 *                   manifest's ask — same-realm code shares the page's fetch,
 *                   so connect is advisory there, enforced only in the frame
 *                   (its CSP connect-src).
 *   context.granted reflects the result; an ungranted capability is null.
 *   Theme and language belong to the host: inside an isolated app a user's
 *   click on a <sac-theme-toggle> / <sac-lang-toggle> switches the HOST (as
 *   the same toggle does same-realm) and the frame follows — never the
 *   frame alone. The app's own sac.commands appear in the host's palette.
 *   sac.apps.identitySalt — the host's secret for pseudonymous ids. Default:
 *                   generated once and kept in localStorage
 *                   ("sac.apps.identity-salt"); set it (e.g. per account,
 *                   from the server) to keep ids stable across devices.
 *   sac.apps.frameUrl  — a host that serves its own harness document: a URL
 *                   string, or (manifest, granted) → URL. Unset, the kit
 *                   builds a srcdoc harness with a CSP from the grant.
 *   sac.apps.kitUrl    — the kit folder the frame loads ("…/kit/"); default
 *                   derived from this script's own URL.
 *   sac.apps.limits    — { timeout: 30000, maxBytes: 64 MiB, rate: 200 } for
 *                   the bridge: call timeout, the ceiling for one payload (a
 *                   Blob's size, or a structured-clone estimate of a value),
 *                   calls per second per frame ("rate-limited" beyond).
 *
 * Pinned installs: a manifest with `integrity` loads its entry with
 * <script integrity crossorigin="anonymous"> (same-realm and in the frame),
 * so the browser refuses changed bytes. add() pins automatically for an
 * isolated install (from entryIntegrity); a same-realm host opts in with
 * add(m, { integrity: true }) or a hash string, and add(m, { integrity:
 * false }) drops a pin. A failed load rejects with a typed error — err.code
 * "integrity" (the entry is reachable but its bytes changed) or "network"
 * (unreachable). Told apart by re-fetching the entry and hashing it after the
 * script tag fails. No integrity = today's behavior, unpinned.
 *
 * mount(context) lifecycle:
 *   The host calls el.mount(context) IF the method exists — exactly once per
 *   element lifetime (re-opening an existing window, or returning to a view,
 *   does NOT re-mount). Windows mount right after the element is appended;
 *   views mount when they first appear on the stage, never while hidden, so
 *   an app that measures (sizing a canvas, scrolling to its route) has a real
 *   box to measure.
 *   el.unmount() (if present) is called only by sac.apps.remove(). Apps that
 *   define neither still work — the contract is opt-in.
 *
 *   context = {
 *       appId: "color-bucket",
 *       manifest: {…},             // the app's own manifest, copied (name/icon/
 *                                  // description/version/notices) — pass it straight
 *                                  // to sac.about.open() for the standard About
 *       params: URLSearchParams,   // deep-link params snapshot at open (empty if none)
 *       route: "components",       // views only: the sub-route after the app id
 *                                  // in "#/<id>/<route>" ("" when there is none)
 *       onRoute(cb),               // views only: cb(route) whenever the sub-route
 *                                  // changes from outside — a rail link, the back
 *                                  // button, a pasted URL. Returns an unsubscribe.
 *       host: {                    // views only, null standalone: what the HOST
 *           name, icon, href,      // injects into the app's own chrome. PLAIN
 *           nav:     [{label, href, icon?}],       // DATA, never DOM nodes —
 *           toolbar: [{icon, label?, title?,       // the app's OWN <sac-nav>
 *                      href? | onClick?}],         // renders every bit of it
 *       },                         // (nav.host = context.host): ⌂ jump, suite
 *                                  // nav in the burger, controls in the ribbon.

 *                                  // entry
